# Sports Data Transformation Project Architecture

## Overview

The Sports Data Transformation Project aims to transform raw sports data into structured formats for analysis and reporting. The architecture comprises several components working together to achieve this transformation effectively.

## Components

### 1. Data Ingestion

- Raw data is obtained from various sources such as CSV files, APIs, or databases.
- The `transform_data.py` script processes this raw data for cleaning and transformation.

### 2. Transformation Engine

- The core logic resides in the `transform_data.py` script.
- It utilizes functions from `utils.py` for data cleaning and restructuring.

### 3. Output

- Transformed data is saved in various formats, including CSV, JSON, or databases, for further analysis.
- Users can access and analyze the transformed data for insights.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Main programming language for data processing.
- Pandas and NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation.
- Other libraries/tools: [List any other tools or libraries used]
